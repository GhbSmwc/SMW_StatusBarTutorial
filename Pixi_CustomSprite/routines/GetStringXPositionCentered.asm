;This routine calculates where to position the string horizontally
;to be centered (text align) to a given reference point. Mainly
;useful for having numbers centered with the body of the sprite.
;
;NOTE: This ALWAYS places each tile 8 pixels away from each tile.
;
;Here is how it works:
; Formula to get the X position of the centered string:
;  StringXPos = (SpriteXPos + OffsetToCenter) - ((NumbOfChar*8)/2)
; Which becomes this because this is procedural programming:
;  (((NumbOfChar*8)/2) * -1) + (SpriteXPos + OffsetToCenter)
; We can reduce 8/2 into 4/1 (results in just multiplying by 4):
;  ((NumbOfChar*4) * -1) + (SpriteXPos + OffsetToCenter)
;Here are what the variables mean:
;-$00 = SpriteXPos (sprite's OAM tile X position, relative to screen border)
;-OffsetToCenter = (signed) how many pixels to the "apparent" center of sprite.
; Most things have their origin XY position at the top and left edge of their "bounding box". In this case
; SpriteXPos is the leftmost pixel of the sprite. Since the body of this sprite is 16x16, we need to go right
; 8 pixels, which is halfway between X=0 and X=16.
;-NumbOfChar = X index
;
;To be called after "SupressLeadingZeros" subroutine (or its variants).
;
;Input:
;-X index: How many characters.
;-$00: Sprite OAM X position, obtained from calling getdrawinfo.
;-$03: X position of the point the string to be centered with, relative to the sprite's origin
; (this routine takes $00, add by whats in $03, and stores to $02)
;Output:
;-$02: X position of the string, for "WriteStringAsSpriteOAM" subroutine.
