09-09-2024 v3.1.0
 - Made all JS code not use innerHTML.
02-15-2025 v3.2.0
 - Percentage rounding variants added.
 - Defines update:
 -- Defines for status bar positioning are now XY-based rather than bytes-offset.
 -- Defines regarding an example usage are now separated into a different ASM text file.
 -- Moved the default RAM "!Scratchram_Frames2TimeOutput" for LoROM due to an update on timer
    written on a stripe image.
 - Timer display now have a new display mode setting for "!ShowHours": "2 significant units only"
   which is intended to show only the highest 2 units that are nonzero, saving tiles and
   "screen real estate", suitable for countdown timers:
 -- If timer is less than a minute, it will show only seconds and centiseconds ("SS.CC").
 -- If timer is between a minute and an hour, will only show minutes and seconds ("MM:SS")
 - Fixed an incorrect statement about WriteRepeatedSymbolsWriteVertically that $0C should
   be either $00 or $01, when actuality should be $00 or $02.
 - Updated the info on WriteRepeatedSymbolsWriteVertically this time mentioning that the
   position inputs refer to the top tile extending downwards for downwards and the bottom tile
   extending upwards when extending upwards.
 - Code blocks in the main readme now uses CSS overflows and re-sizable for ease of reading.
 - Added full explanation about stripe tiles crossing tilemap screen border.
 - Corrected various incorrect info on the warmup: "$7E0EF9-$7E0F2E" should be "$7E0EF9-$7E0F2F"
   and in "Create an ASM file to run under" stated that the LDA and STA values should be
 - Added info about subroutine "WriteStringDigitsToHUD" in the main HTML file
 - Fixed a bug on SpriteHUDTest.asm when set to display 2 numbers and the player presses right,
   would increment the high word of the first of the two numbers when it should only increment
   only the second number, due to a typo on the if statement on determining should the increment
   be 16-bit or 32-bit.
 - Added to the HTML file what was missing was the subroutines that convert status bar characters
   to overworld border characters.
 - Fixed an issue where if you simply set !OverWorldBorderBlankTile to any other value besides
   $1F, the routines "SixteenBitHexDecDivisionToOWB" and "ThirtyTwoBitHexDecDivisionToOWB"
   wouldn't update to that because I forgot to make it use such a define.
 - Added signed HexDec routines. These handles a two's complement values.
 - Added 16x8 ("bonus stars" number) support.
05-02-2025 v3.2.1
 - Fixed an oversight that I forgot to update the HTML formatting (content centered rather than
   on the left edge of the viewport) for other HTML files.
 - Updated the link to a youtube video "Binary to decimal can’t be that hard, right?" to point to
   a more appropriate video time.
08-03-2025 v3.2.1 some more description and sample updates
 - Fixed an error on "CountingAnimation16Bit" that when "Gradual" is greater than "Actual", it is
   supposed to decrease Gradual towards actual and therefore "-=" is a more appropriate than "+="
 - Mentioned 2 miscellaneous subroutines with a table: StringTo8x16Char and
   CountingAnimation16Bit.
 - Mentioned on Frames2Timer that hours' maximum that it can safely represent is 255, and thus
   the maximum timer value is $034BBFFF, which is 255 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds, and 59
   frames (about 98 centiseconds).
 - Added notice in the comments about repeated symbols routine.
 - Renamed "FramesToTimer" to "TimerToFrames" to avoid misleading name.
 - Fixed grammar issue with the readme explaining the 8x16 graphic.
 - Added note about Direct Indirect Long and SA-1 that writing a 1 or 2 bytes address may break.
 - Added even slower counting animation for sample use of "CountingAnimation16Bit" by only
   counting by 1 on certain frames if the Gradual value and actual value difference is low enough.
 - Corrected "Supress" to "Suppress".
02-08-2026 v3.2.1 - minor changes
 - Fixed several potential crashes with tile properties.
 - Made tile properties settings be split into individual parts (Page, Palette, Priority, XFlip,
   and YFlip).
 - Replaced every instances of "OverWorldBorder" with "OverworldBorder" of some inconsistency.
 - Fixed typos that falsely says that the status bar RAM ends at $7E0F2E when it supposed to be
   $7E0F2F.
