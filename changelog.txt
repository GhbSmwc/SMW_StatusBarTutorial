 - Defines update:
 -- Defines for status bar positioning are now XY-based rather than bytes-offset.
 -- Defines regarding an example usage are now separated into a different ASM text file.
 - Timer display now have a new display mode setting for "!ShowHours": "2 significant units only"
   which is intended to show only the highest 2 units that are nonzero, saving tiles and
   "screen real estate", suitable for countdown timers:
 -- If timer is less than a minute, it will show only seconds and centiseconds ("SS.CC").
 -- If timer is between a minute and an hour, will only show minutes and seconds ("MM:SS")
 - Fixed an incorrect statement about WriteRepeatedSymbolsWriteVertically that $0C should
   be either $00 or $01, when actuality should be $00 or $02.
 - Updated the info on WriteRepeatedSymbolsWriteVertically this time mentioning that the
   position inputs refer to the top tile extending downwards for downwards and the bottom tile
   extending upwards when extending upwards.
